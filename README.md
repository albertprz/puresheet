## Description

Spreadsheet management application implemented on [Halogen](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen).

This is currently still a Work In Progress, with the goal of streamlining the core functionality of a spreadsheet application,  by offering only a opinionated subset of the features offered by mainstream solutions and more focused around data manipulation rather than text / cell formatting, for example.

## Goals

Ideally, it should provide an ergonomic and simple to use formulas, sorting & filtering API in a specialized language for just pure spreadsheet data transformations, along with some of the power of a general functional programming language and some notion of type safety as for validation of the formulas and error reporting.
